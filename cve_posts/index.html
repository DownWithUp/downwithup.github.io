            About CVE-2018-16713 | IObit Advanced SystemCare's Monitor_win10_x64.sys v1.2.0.5 arbitrary RDMSR: <br>
            IObit Advanced SystemCare, which includes Monitor_win10_x64.sys or Monitor_win7_x64.sys, 1.2.0.5 (and possibly earlier versions) allows a user to send an IOCTL (0x9C402084) with a buffer containing user defined content. The driver's subroutine will execute a rdmsr instruction with the user's buffer for input, and provide output from the instruction.<br>
            Security Risk Level: <br>
            CVSS (v3.0) = 3.2 Low <br>
            Possible Solution(s) / Fixe(s): <br>
            Prevent rdmsr from being accessed in from user mode. <br>
